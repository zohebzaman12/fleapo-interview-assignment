Overview
This project showcases a responsive web page created using HTML5 and CSS3. The page design is inspired by a Figma prototype and includes both desktop and mobile views.

Features
Desktop View
Layout: The desktop view features a flexible, multi-column layout with distinct sections for quarter information and company details.
Design: Utilizes a color-coded system for different quarters, with hover effects on the quarter symbols.
Content: Displays a detailed roadmap of activities across four quarters, with visually distinct sections for each period.
About Section: Includes company information with a call-to-action button and a prominent image.
Mobile View
Responsive Design: The mobile view adapts the layout for smaller screens by hiding certain elements and reformatting the content.
Image Display: The mobile version features a single image that is optimized for smaller screens, replacing the desktop layoutâ€™s more complex arrangement.
Styling
Fonts and Colors: The design uses the 'Century Gothic' font and a color scheme that includes shades of green, blue, yellow, and red for various elements.
Buttons: Styled with transitions for smooth hover effects.
Clipouts: Decorative elements are included at the top and bottom of the page, adding visual interest.
Responsive Design
